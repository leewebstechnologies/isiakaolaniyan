          I CAN SUM UP EVERYTHING I’VE EVER LEARNED ABOUT BLOGGING IN ONE
          SENTENCE:
        </h5>
        <h1>Create Content Like a Startup, Not a Writer.</h1>
        <p>
          If you want to learn how to start a blog to make life-changing money,
          you need to stop writing and start developing systems to scale your
          blog like a business, not a hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          I launched this blog in January 2019 and as you can see from my Blog
          Income Reports, I now make over $250k/month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two years ago, I was at a corporate job, building my blog on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took what I learned in the startup world and started to scale my
          personal brand like a startup.
        </p>
        <p>
          By treating my blog like a real business from day one, I stopped being
          the tortured writer and became the CEO.

          <b>First, let’s face it – most blogging advice is outdated.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re sold the dream of "passive income" (which doesn't exist), all
          while 99% of bloggers are still failing, and the same old school
          “influencers” who started 5-10 years ago are the ones making money
          online.
        </p>
        <p>I hate to break it to you, but you’ve been lied to.</p>
        <p>
          These old-school influencers tell you to write about your passions,
          stay consistent, form good writing habits, and create fantastic
          content. Then, a few years from now, you’ll finally have enough
          traffic to monetize your blog with affiliate links, ads, online
          courses, or other digital products.
        </p>
        <p>To grow your blog in the 2020s, you need new tactics. </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            The entire reason I created this blog was to abandon this old advice
            and update your blogging tactics.
          </b>
